A collection of development tools I've used over the years, all consolidated in one location

git-as - Allows users of pairing stations to assume- the identity of a different user when committing.
    $ git as derrick commit -m "Committing as thrawn"
    $ git as ryan commit -m "Committing as ryan"
    or
    $ git as derrick
    $ git commit -m "Committing as thrawn"
    $ git as ryan
    $ git commit -m "Committing as ryan"
    $ git commit -m "Committing again as ryan"

git-publish - Makes publishing a branch to a remote server a 1 command operation
    # Create a new branch
    $ git branch my-branch
    # Publish the branch back to the repo. So others can check out your branch
    $ git publish

git-track - Allows users to track a remote branch so they can commit back to the remote branch
    $ git track my-branch
